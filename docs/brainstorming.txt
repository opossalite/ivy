when to inline a function and when to copy the definition?
well, technically currying is an option for both inlining and referencing
curry referencing can be done by auto-filling the parameters, while
inline currying is basically just filling in all the locations with the value
and removing that extra parameter
... might require some thinking, or could just not inline for now and do that later
