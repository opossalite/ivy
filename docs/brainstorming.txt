but sometimes you don't wanna use a string, so this is the proper
multiline comment

action vs expression

action:
defining variables
bringing variables into scope
dropping variables from scope
imports

expression:
everything else

what does a definition need?
a variable name, type, definition

c:
type name = definition

python:
name = definition

rust:
name: type = definition

go:
name type = definition

'''
when to inline a function and when to copy the definition?
well, technically currying is an option for both inlining and referencing
curry referencing can be done by auto-filling the parameters, while
inline currying is basically just filling in all the locations with the value
and removing that extra parameter
... might require some thinking, or could just not inline for now and do that later
'''



# currying showcase
let add_four_nums = ([x, y, z, a] x + y + z + a)
let add_two_nums = add_four_nums(0, $, $, 0) #currying involves only filling in the parameters you want
let add_six = add_four_nums(2, 5, $, 1)

let res = add_two_nums(3, 2) #results in 5
let res = add_six(4) #results in 10


let y = 3.0
let z = y -> i8 #converts y to an i8
let a = 3.0 >> i8 #converts y to an i8 via bits (error in this case cuz size differences)
#maybe want to switch these two

'''
possible example of a main function:
this will run at the end, turning the file from a script to a normal file
otherwise without a {main}, the file will just run top to bottom, right??

okay no, let's do it like this:
python has
if __name__ == "__main__":
    do_random_things()
but here, putting {main} before a variable will simply execute
that variable if this is in fact a main file, and not otherwise

this way, people can write scripts and they'll work just fine
and {main}s will still execute if they are the main file that was run

'''

{main}
let random_name = []
    do_random_things()
